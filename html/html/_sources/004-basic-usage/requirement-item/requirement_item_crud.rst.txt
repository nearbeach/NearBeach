Requirement Items are the broken down requirements into more detailed parts. Think of them as user stories. Whilst the
requirement is the high/helicopter level of detail. The requirement items are the lower/ground level details.

higher helicopter looks, where as the Requirement Items are more detailed and closer to the ground level.
