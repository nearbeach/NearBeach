Notes:

* Any new features, should have the feature created from the `develop` branch
* Any new hotfixes, should have the hotfix created from the `main` branch
* Any new releases, will automatically trigger the github actions, and preform a release
* If releasing new code, the release should be created from the `develop` branch
* If releasing separate from development, i.e. deploying same code base with updated libraries, then follow the
  deployment instructions.
