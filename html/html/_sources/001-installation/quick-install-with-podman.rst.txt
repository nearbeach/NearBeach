            volumes:
            - .:/ceansuite
            ports:
            - 8000:8000
            - 2525:2525
            restart: unless-stopped
            depends_on:
            - db


#. Inside the podman-compose.yaml file, edit the SECRET_KEY. This will be a large string with symbols, letters and
   numbers. You can use a generate like https://djecrety.ir/


#. Inside the podman-compose.yaml file, fill out the following fields appropriately. SMTP is used to send the reset
   password functionality. This is one of the methods required to login for the first time.

    - SMTP_EMAIL_HOST
    - SMTP_EMAIL_PORT
    - SMTP_EMAIL_HOST_USER
    - SMTP_EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD


#. The administration username/email will be used to log into NearBeach. This will need to be filled out appropriately
   because changing

    - ADMIN_USERNAME
    - ADMIN_EMAIL


#. Inside the podman-compose.yaml file, there are two services. One will be for setting up the Database, and the other
   service will setup NearBeach. You will need to fill out the database connection/details. Please note you will need the
   same variable value for the following pairs;

    - DB_DATABASE / MARIADB_DATABASE
    - DB_USER / MARIADB_USER
    - DB_PASSWORD / MARIADB_PASSWORD
    - MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD

    MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD will not have a pair.


#. Fill out the CSRF_TRUSTED_URLS value. This will need to be the EXACT domain. Please view the examples below

    .. code-block:: bash

        CSRF_TRUSTED_URLS=https://demo.nearbeach.org

    If you would like to demo NearBeach, please fill out the following

    .. code-block:: bash

        CSRF_TRUSTED_URLS=http://localhost:8000,http://127.0.0.1:8000

#. Fill out the ALLOWED_HOSTS. This will be similar to the CSRF_TRUSTED, but without the http and port numbers.

    .. code-block:: bash

        - ALLOWED_HOST=demo.nearbeach.org


    Alternatively - if using localhost


    .. code-block:: bash

        - ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1


#. Use your Azure Blob storage to store uploaded files from NearBeach. If you don't require Azure Blob storage, please
   delete these two lines;

    .. code-block:: bash

        - AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING
        - AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME


#. Using a terminal, change directory to the location that you stored the podman-compose file. Run the following
   command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        podman-compose up -d

   If you would like to specify a project name for your NearBeach instance. Run the
   following command instead:

    .. code-block:: bash

        podman-compose up -d --project-name NearBeach


You are now up and running NearBeach in Docker. Visiting the URL you set in the `CSRF_TRUSTED_URLS` in your browser will
take you to NearBeach.

For first time logins, you will need to reset your password. There are two different methods.

#. Clicking "Reset" password and filling out your email will send you a password reset.

#. Using a terminal, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        podman exec -it <<PODMAN-CONTAINER-NAME>> python3 ./manage.py changepassword <<ADMIN_USERNAME>>


   This will ask for a new password.
