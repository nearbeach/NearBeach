Setting up the project
======================

  1. | Head over to https://github.com/nearbeach/NearBeach and fork the repository to your own github account. You can skip this step if dont want to fork.


  2. Open a terminal, navigate to a folder where you want to setup this project

    .. code-block:: bash

      cd /path/to/your/project/folder

  3. Download the project from the forked repository. Copy the link from the forked repository and run the following command in the terminal.

    .. code-block:: bash

      git clone <<Forked repo URL here>>
      cd ./NearBeach

    If you have not forked the repository, you can clone the main repository using the following command

    .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/nearbeach/NearBeach.git
      cd ./NearBeach

  4. Download and install virtualenv

    .. code-block:: bash

      sudo pip3 install virtualenv

  5. Create your own virtual environment for python
    
    .. note::
      you can use any name for the virtual environment, but it is recommended to use "venv" as it is already added to the .gitignore file
      
    .. code-block:: bash

      virtualenv venv
    
    This will create a directory called "venv" in your current directory, this will store the required python libraries for the project

  6. Activate the virtual environment

    .. code-block:: bash

      source ./venv/bin/activate

    You terminal prompt will change to indicate that it is working in the virtual environment now. It should look like the following:

      .. code-block:: bash
        
        (venv)user@computer NearBeach$:

  7. Install the python libraries
    
    This will install all the required python libraries for the project

    .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

  8. Create the database

    .. code-block:: bash

      python3 manage.py migrate

  9. Create a superuser for the application

    | Execute the following command and fill the user details when prompted.
    | This user will act as super user for the NearBeach application. Use this user to login to the website once the Django app runs.

    .. code-block:: bash
    
      python3 manage.py createsuperuser

  10. Run the Django webserver

    .. code-block:: bash
    
      python3 manage.py runserver

    Alternatively, you can run the server on a different port using the following command

    .. code-block:: bash

      python3 manage.py runserver <<Port number>>

    .. attention::
      
      If you see an error message like "DisallowedHost at /", you need to add 127.0.0.1 to the allowed hosts in the :code:`local/settings.py` file. 
      Open :code:`local/settings.py` file and add :code:`127.0.0.1` to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list

      .. code-block:: python

        ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1']

  If all the above steps are followed correctly you should see the following output:

    .. code-block:: bash
