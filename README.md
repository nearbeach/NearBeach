## What is NearBeach?

NearBeach is an open source project management system, built using Django and VueJS. The phillosophy of NearBeach is to be easy to install and use, be open sourced, and to be flexible. NearBeach is currently aimed at small/personal organisation to large enterprises. Each new module brought to NearBeach expands it's capability tenfold and brings it closer to a competing product.
