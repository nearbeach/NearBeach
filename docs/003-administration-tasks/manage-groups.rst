Create User Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    Each group will require a unique name.

.. note::
    Users can be in multiple groups, with different permissions to each group

.. note::
    Permission sets can be stacked for users within that group. i.e. Read Only user can have extra permissions stacked on top.

1. Log into NearBeach as an administrator

2. Choose the "Administration" option in the menu and select the "Groups"

3. The "Group List" page will load

4. Click the "Create a new Group" to start creating a new permission list

Once the group has been created, you will be able to add permission sets + users. User's have to be connected to a permission set.

.. note::
    At least one user in the group should be tagged as group leader.
