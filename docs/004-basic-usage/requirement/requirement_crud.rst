Requirements should be split up into smaller sections (or items). Requirement items are those sections. Requirements are
higher helicopter looks, where as the Requirement Items are more detailed and closer to the ground level.

For example: The below section has a requirement, which then has three requirement items.

* **Requirement:** Build a website

* **Requirement Item:** Website widget to inform customer of current operational status
* **Requirement Item:** Website design should match the new branding
