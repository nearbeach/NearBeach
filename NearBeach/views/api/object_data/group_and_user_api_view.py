# ðŸ“Œ Description

This endpoint allows you to add either a user or a group to a specific object (e.g., Project, Task, Kanban Card, etc.).

To obtain valid user and group IDs, use the GET method on this endpoint and refer to the 'potential_user_list' and 
'potential_group_list' fields in the response.


# ðŸ§¾ Parameters

- Destination: The type of object you're linking to. Must be one of the following:
    - Kanban Card
    - Project
    - Request for Change
    - Requirement
    - Requirement Item
    - Task
- Location ID: The unique ID of the specific object you're modifying (e.g., the project ID or task ID).
- ID: This should always be set to 0. (This is a required field for request formatting, but not used during creation.)

# âœ… Notes
- Make sure the user or group you are trying to add appears in the potential_user_list or potential_group_list 
respectively. If not, they may already be associated with the object.

# ðŸ“Œ Description

This API endpoint provides group and user-related information for a specified object. It returns several categorized lists that can be used by the frontend to manage group and user assignments.

# Returned Fields:

- **Object Group List**: A list of groups currently assigned to the object.
- **Object User List**: A list of users currently assigned to the object.
- **Potential Group List**: A list of groups that *can* be assigned to the object.
- **Potential User List**: A list of users that *can* be assigned to the object.
- **User Group List**: A list of groups that the current authenticated user is a member of.

This endpoint is primarily used by the frontend in the "Group and User" section to retrieve relevant assignment data.
