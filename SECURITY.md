## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please contact our security team via email security@nearbeach.org. Please provide detail explaination on how to replicate this security issue.

## Hacking Sandbox

Sometimes the only way to actually find security issues, is to have an environment to... break into. We fully understand this, however we don't want you to break into anyone's environment.

Instead, why don't you contact us at security@nearbeach.org, and we'll be happy to setup a random non-production environment for you to play around in. We only want you to inform us of any security issues and if you know of any fixes.
