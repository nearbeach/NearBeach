        export default {
            name: "ExampleComponent",

                propVariable: {

### Python

Please refer to the [PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

## Donating

Like most projects, there are some overhead costs. Every single dollar that we get will go towards;

-   Software costs
-   Administration costs
-   Freelance costs (i.e. hiring help like designers)

We are being transparent with all our costs and will try and provide a yearly cost breakdown every 6 months.
