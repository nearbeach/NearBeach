##  Hacktoberfest 2021

Welcome to NearBeach, we are super glad you are here. In the following month of Hacktoberfest we are hoping to achieve the following goals/milestones.

- Update our VueJS library to VueJS 3+
- Update our Webpacker from version 4 to version 5
- Increase our code coverage for both Django and VueJS
- Increase our E2E testing with Cypress.io
- Bug test whole application
- Fix bugs listed in the [Github Issues](https://github.com/robotichead/NearBeach/issues).
- Improve user documentation
- Start working on Docker installation process

This seems a lot to cover within such a short time frame, but we are hoping you are willing to help us. We greatly appreciate all the help we can get no matter how small the contribution.
